# My Portfolio 🏗️ (Currently under development)

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts 🧶
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes, then the app is ready to be deployed!
